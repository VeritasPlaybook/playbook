# AI in Payments, Compliance & Fraud Protection

Research, frameworks, and practical insights at the intersection of AI and financial crime prevention.

## What's Here

Exploring how AI is transforming:
- **Fraud Detection** – Real-time pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- **AML & Compliance** – Reducing false positives and automating regulatory workflows
- **Payment Security** – Scam disruption, transaction monitoring, and risk scoring
- **Product Strategy** – Building AI-powered fintech products that balance security and user experience

## Published Work

*Coming soon – research and frameworks in development*

## Currently Researching

- AI-driven fraud detection architectures and when traditional rules still win
- Reducing false positives in AML transaction monitoring without sacrificing coverage
- Real-time risk scoring for payment authorization decisions
- Regulatory considerations for AI in financial crime compliance (explainability, audit trails, bias)
- Cross-border payment fraud patterns and emerging scam tactics
- Building product roadmaps for AI-powered compliance tooling

## Why This Matters

Financial institutions face an evolving threat landscape where traditional rule-based systems struggle to keep pace. AI offers transformative potential—but only when implemented with deep domain knowledge, regulatory awareness, and operational pragmatism.

This repository documents my thinking as I work through real problems in payments and compliance.
