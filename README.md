# Veritas Playbook

**Practical workflows and systems for knowledge workers**

This is my playbook—a collection of guides, workflows, examples, and templates that I've built and refined over time. I'll be adding content as questions come up and sharing what actually works.

## 📚 What's Inside

### [Career](./career/)
Starting with resume writing. Will expand naturally based on what people ask about.

### [Productivity](./productivity/)
Currently thinking about workflow optimization and time management systems.

### [AI Systems](./ai-systems/)
Currently thinking about practical AI workflows and power user techniques.

### [Decision Frameworks](./decision-frameworks/)
Currently thinking about mental models and systematic decision-making.

## 💡 Approach

- **Real-world tested** - I use these systems regularly
- **Practical over perfect** - 80/20 approaches that actually get used
- **Expanding organically** - Adding guides as questions come up naturally

## 🚀 What You'll Find

Each guide includes:
- Step-by-step workflows
- Real examples
- Templates and samples
- Lessons learned
